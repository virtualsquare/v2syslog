.SH "NAME"
\fBv2syslog\.conf\fR \- \fBv2syslogd\fR(1) configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The syntax is similar to \fBsyslog\.conf\fR(5): "Every rule consists of two fields, a selector field and an action field\. These two fields are separated by one or more spaces or tabs\. The selector field specifies a pattern of facilities and priorities belonging to the specified action\."
.P
Lines beginning by # are comments\.
.P
The syntax of selectors is the same described in \fBsyslog\.conf\fR(5)\.
.P
The action can be the pathname of a file or the pathname of a script/program prefixed by \fB!\fR\. In the former case (file) all log messages matching the selector are added (in append mode) to the named file\. It is possible to add a format string at the end of the line\. The format string is similar to printf or strftime format strings: all the characters of the format are verbtim copied to the output except for the following conversion specifications:
.TP
\fB%%\fR
a percent symbol\.
.TP
\fB%P\fR
the priority name\.
.TP
\fB%F\fR
the facility name
.TP
\fB%t\fR
the local time of the reception of the message by v2syslogd, using the format of the Example 4, RFC 5424, section 6\.2\.3\.1\.
.TP
\fB%T\fR
the local time of the reception of the message by v2syslogd, using the BSD legacy format (RFC 3164 compliant)

.TP
\fB%I\fR

.TP
\fB%i\fR

.TP
\fB%h\fR

.TP
\fB%K\fR
the IP address if defined otherwise the nodename
.TP
\fB%a\fR
the application
.TP
\fB%p\fR
the process id
.TP
\fB%[\fR
returns [pid] if the process id is defined, an empty string otherwise
.TP
\fB%M\fR
the message id
.TP
\fB%s\fR
the structured data
.TP
\fB%m\fR
the log message
.P
